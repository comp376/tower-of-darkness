Opening the solution in the first tower-of-darkness-xna folder should open the project.
-Controls are listed in the How to Play section in the Main Menu.
-To turn on GodMode: Go to the Character class, and change the boolean "godmode" to true.
-To turn on debug mode: Change the boolean "DEBUG" in the LevelState class to true.
	Debug mode graphically shows all collidable objects.

Have fun!

Thanks,
Joel, Nick and Brendan.
